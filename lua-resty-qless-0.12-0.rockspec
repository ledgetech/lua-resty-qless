  summary    = "Lua binding to Qless (Queue / Pipeline management) for OpenResty",
  detailed   = [[
    lua-resty-qless is a binding to qless-core from Moz - a powerful Redis
    based job queueing system inspired by resque, but instead implemented as
    a collection of Lua scripts for Redis.
    This binding provides a full implementation of Qless via Lua script running
    in OpenResty / lua-nginx-module, including workers which can be started
    during the init_worker_by_lua phase.
    Essentially, with this module and a modern Redis instance, you can turn
    your OpenResty server into a quite sophisticated yet lightweight job
    queuing system, which is also compatible with the reference Ruby
    implementation, Qless.
    Note: This module is not designed to work in a pure Lua environment.
